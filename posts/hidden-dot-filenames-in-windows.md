If you are trying to name a file in Windows so it starts with a dot, such as .htaccess or .gitignore, you will get an error "You must type a filename". 

To get around this, all you need to do is type the filename with an ending dot as well, like this:

.htaccess.

Windows will accept the filename this way, and drop the final period!
