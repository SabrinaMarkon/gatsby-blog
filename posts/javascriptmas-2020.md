By the time I found Scrimba's super fun 24 Days of JavaScriptmas challenge, I think it was already December 16 or so, so I am playing catch-up to try to get them all done in time to win my certificate and a ticket into the $1000.00 lottery!

Here are my solutions so far! I am proud to say that I did not peek at any of the solutions that were already posted by the time I joined, and worked them out myself, even if some might have a better solution than the one I came up with.
